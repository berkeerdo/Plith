# Plith

Modern Windows audio OSD with Voicemeeter-first design + integrated media controls. Replaces Windows' aging volume flyout with a Mica/rounded overlay that works over fullscreen games and shows now-playing media inline.

## Status
**Planning complete, implementation not started.** Bootstrap will create `src/Plith/` WPF project on Day 1.

## Stack
- **WPF + .NET 10 (LTS)** — proven topmost-over-fullscreen path via BandWindow + renamed `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` (borrowed from MIT-licensed VoicemeeterFancyOSD's Host/Bridge/Interop layer).
- Voicemeeter Remote API via `VoicemeeterRemote64.dll` P/Invoke.
- Windows Media Session via `Windows.Media.Control.GlobalSystemMediaTransportControlsSessionManager`.
- Mica/Acrylic via `DwmSetWindowAttribute` (Win11 21H2+).

## Read these in order
1. **PLAN.md** — full implementation plan (3 phases, file structure, conventions, references)
2. **NOTICE.md** — third-party credits (FancyOSD MIT)

## Next actions
1. `dotnet --list-sdks` — confirm .NET 10 SDK is installed (we have runtime; SDK may need `winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.10`)
2. Bootstrap solution per PLAN.md §7
3. Begin Phase 1 (Voicemeeter-first MVP) per PLAN.md §5
